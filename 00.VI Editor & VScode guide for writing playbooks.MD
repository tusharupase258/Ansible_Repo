# Writing Ansible Playbooks with Vi Editor and VSCode: A Detailed Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of writing Ansible playbooks using two different editors: **Vi Editor** and **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**. Each approach is detailed separately to cater to your preference.

## 1. Writing an Ansible Playbook using Vi Editor

Vi Editor is a powerful and widely available text editor in Unix-like systems. It may seem complex at first, but mastering it can make editing files quick and efficient.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Using Vi Editor

### Step 1: Open the Terminal
- Ensure you are in your Ansible directory or navigate to it:
  ```bash
  cd /etc/ansible/Playbooks
  ```
  (Or navigate to your preferred directory.)

### Step 2: Create or Open a Playbook File in Vi
- Use the following command to open a new or existing playbook file:
  ```bash
  sudo vi my_playbook.yml
  ```
  This will open the **vi editor**.

### Step 3: Enter Insert Mode to Write
- Once the file is opened, press the **`i`** key to enter **Insert Mode**.
- You can now start writing your Ansible playbook.

**Example Playbook:**
```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: Ping the localhost
      ping:
```

### Step 4: Save and Exit the Vi Editor
- To save and exit:
  1. Press **`ESC`** to leave Insert Mode.
  2. Type **`:wq`** (Write and Quit) and press **Enter**.

If you want to quit without saving, use **`:q!`** instead.

### Step 5: Verify the Playbook Creation
- List the directory to ensure the playbook was created:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```

### Step 6: Run Your Playbook
- Run the playbook using:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook my_playbook.yml
  ```

## 2. Writing an Ansible Playbook using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

VSCode is a modern text editor that offers a more user-friendly interface, with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and extensions for easier playbook writing.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Using VSCode

### Step 1: Install VSCode (if not already installed)
- Download and install VSCode from the official site: [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 2: Open VSCode
- Launch VSCode and open the directory where you want to create the playbook.

### Step 3: Install the Ansible Extension (Optional, but Recommended)
- VSCode has a dedicated extension for Ansible, which provides syntax highlighting and other helpful features.
  - Go to **Extensions** (on the sidebar or press **Ctrl+Shift+X**).
  - Search for **Ansible** and install the extension.

### Step 4: Create a New Playbook File
- In VSCode, click on **File > New File** or press **Ctrl+N**.
- Save the file as `my_playbook.yml`:
  - Go to **File > Save As** or press **Ctrl+S**.
  - Name the file and ensure the extension is `.yml`.

### Step 5: Write the Ansible Playbook
- Write your playbook in VSCode. The installed Ansible extension will help with auto-completion and syntax checking.

**Example Playbook:**
```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: Ping the localhost
      ping:
```

### Step 6: Save the Playbook
- To save the file, press **Ctrl+S** or go to **File > Save**.

### Step 7: Verify the Playbook in Terminal
- Open the terminal inside VSCode or use a separate terminal.
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/playbook
  ls
  ```
  Ensure the `my_playbook.yml` file is listed.

### Step 8: Run Your Playbook
- In the terminal, run the playbook:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook my_playbook.yml
  ```
