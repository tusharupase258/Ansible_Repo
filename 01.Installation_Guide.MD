To install Ansible on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### 1. Update the system packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install the software properties package to manage PPAs (if not already installed):
```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```

### 3. Add the Ansible PPA:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
```

### 4. Install Ansible:
```bash
sudo apt install ansible
```

### 5. Verify the installation:
```bash
ansible --version
```
---

### 6. Check Ansible Status on Localhost
After installation, you can verify that Ansible is properly set up and able to communicate with the localhost by using the `ping` module. This ensures that Ansible can successfully manage the local machine.

Run the following command:

```bash
ansible localhost -m ping
```

If everything is working, you should see an output like:

```bash
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

This confirms that Ansible is ready and able to communicate with the localhost.

This will install the latest stable version of Ansible from the official PPA on your Ubuntu system.
